    üìä **Daily Trends:**
    - Peak issue day: {peak_day} with {peak_day_count} issues.
    - Average daily issues: {avg_daily:.2f}
    - Issue trend over time: {trend}

    üìÖ **Weekly Trends:**
    - Peak issue week: {peak_week} with {peak_week_count} issues.
    - Average weekly issues: {avg_weekly:.2f}

    ‚ö†Ô∏è **Operational Risk:**
    - High issue volume on {peak_day} may indicate a systemic or recurring problem.
    - Weekly peak ({peak_week}) should be reviewed for root cause analysis.

    üßë‚Äçüíª **Engineer Performance:**
    - Top engineer: {top_engineer}
    - Consider reviewing workload balance if {top_engineer_name} consistently handles > {top_engineer_count} issues.

    üõ†Ô∏è **Common Issues:**
    - Most frequent issue: {most_frequent_issue}
    - Frequent issues may impact client satisfaction. Recommend prioritizing fixes or automation.

    ‚úÖ **Recommendations:**
    - Investigate peak periods for root causes.
    - Review engineer workload distribution.
    - Address top recurring issues to reduce future volume.
    - Consider automation or SOP updates for frequent issues.
